## The Assignment

In the fall of my sophomore year at SEBS, our English 2 class was given a creative assignment: make an art project inspired by Sir Edmund Hillary's legendary 1953 ascent of Mount Everest. Most of my classmates painted, drew, etc. I asked Mrs. Trujillo if a videogame counted as art. She said yes (shout out to Mrs. Trujillo for being awesome), and so began one of my most frantic and memorable weekend projects.

## Building a Mountain (in Code)

With just a few days to make something worth presenting to the class, I locked myself in my room and set out to build a game in Game Maker that would capture the spirit of the climb. The result: **Scaling Everest**, a platformer where you play as Hillary, dodging avalanches, braving the cold, and making your way to the summit. The graphics were... let's call them "retro" (read: MS Paint chic), and the gameplay was simple, but it was mine.

I wish I could share the source code, but somewhere between high school and adulthood, it vanished into the digital ether. All that's left is the original Windows executable. So, if you're on a Mac or Linux, you'll have to borrow a friend's PC (or try your luck with Wine).

## Reflections

Looking back, Scaling Everest was less about the code and more about the climbâ€”both Hillary's and my own. It was the first time I convinced a teacher that a videogame could be art, and the first time I convinced my friend Jacquelyn to star in a videogame. If you manage to get it running, let me know if you make it to the top.
