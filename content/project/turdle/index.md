## Overview

**Turdle** is a Wordle clone I created during the 2022 Global Game Jam weekend, capitalizing on the world's Wordle obsession at the time. Instead of guessing words, players guess sequences of animated turtles, each with different colors and animation frames. The game features a mathematically generated puzzle system that guarantees unique daily challenges for 42 years.

## The Challenge: 42 Years of Unique Puzzles

The most technically challenging aspect of Turdle was creating a system that generates unique daily puzzles without hardcoding a dictionary like the original Wordle. I needed to mathematically generate all possible valid turtle animation sequences and ensure each day had a different puzzle.

### The Permutation Algorithm

The core innovation lies in the `generateAllValidGuesses()` function in `src/constants/validGuesses.ts`:

```typescript
function generateAllValidGuesses(): string[] {
  let guesses: string[] = []
  const sequences = generateStartingSequences()
  for (let i = sequences.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    let sequence = shiftArrayRight(sequences[i])
    for (let j = 0; j < NUM_FRAMES; j++) {
      const wordGuess = sequence.reduce((prefix, l) => prefix + l)
      if (!guesses.includes(wordGuess)) {
        guesses.push(wordGuess)
      }
      sequence = shiftArrayRight(sequence)
    }
  }
  guesses = shuffle(guesses, xor(1))
  return guesses
}
```

### Turtle Animation System

Each turtle has:
- **5 animation frames** (1-5)
- **5 colors** (White, Blue, Purple, Red, Green)
- **25 possible combinations** per position

The system generates all valid 5-turtle sequences where:
- Each turtle has a unique frame number
- Colors can repeat but frames cannot
- Sequences are rotated and shuffled to create variety

This generates exactly **15,625 unique puzzles** - enough for 42.8 years of daily games!

## Features

Features tagged with 🖌️ are ones I created beyond the original repository I forked.

### Accessibility Features
- **🖌️ High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for colorblind players
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Automatic system preference detection
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for accessibility

### Fun Extras
- **🖌️ Meme Mode**: Switch from turtles to 💩 emojis for a humorous twist
- **🖌️ Hard Mode**: Prevents selecting previously incorrect turtle combinations
- **Statistics Tracking**: Persistent game statistics with offline storage

### PWA Capabilities
- **🖌️ Offline Play**: Full offline functionality via service workers
- **🖌️ Mobile Installation**: Can be installed as a native app on mobile devices
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Statistics can be transferred between devices
- **🖌️ Background Updates**: Automatic updates when online
- **Archive Access**: Play previous daily puzzles through the calendar feature

### Service Worker Implementation

The PWA functionality is powered by a comprehensive service worker that handles offline caching, background updates, and app shell routing:

```typescript
// src/service-worker.ts
import { clientsClaim } from 'workbox-core'
import { ExpirationPlugin } from 'workbox-expiration'
import { createHandlerBoundToURL, precacheAndRoute } from 'workbox-precaching'
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing'
import { StaleWhileRevalidate } from 'workbox-strategies'

declare const self: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope

clientsClaim()

// Precache all assets generated by build process
precacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST)

// App Shell routing for SPA navigation
const fileExtensionRegexp = new RegExp('/[^/?]+\\.[^/]+$')
registerRoute(
  ({ request, url }: { request: Request; url: URL }) => {
    if (request.mode !== 'navigate') return false
    if (url.pathname.startsWith('/_')) return false
    if (url.pathname.match(fileExtensionRegexp)) return false
    return true
  },
  createHandlerBoundToURL(process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/index.html')
)

// Runtime caching for images
registerRoute(
  ({ url }) => url.origin === self.location.origin && url.pathname.endsWith('.png'),
  new StaleWhileRevalidate({
    cacheName: 'images',
    plugins: [new ExpirationPlugin({ maxEntries: 50 })],
  })
)

// Handle skip waiting for updates
self.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.data && event.data.type === 'SKIP_WAITING') {
    self.skipWaiting()
  }
})
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **React 17** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Workbox** for service worker management
- **Date-fns** for date calculations
- **Grapheme Splitter** for Unicode support

### Key Components
- **Permutation Generator**: Mathematical algorithm for unique puzzles
- **Animation System**: CSS-based turtle animations
- **State Management**: Local storage with encryption
- **PWA Service Worker**: Offline caching and updates
- **Statistics Engine**: Persistent game data

### Performance Optimizations
- **Predictable Shuffling**: XOR-based PRNG for consistent daily puzzles
- **Efficient Caching**: Service worker precaching for fast loads
- **Minimal Bundle**: Optimized for mobile performance

## Success Metrics

**Peak Performance:**
- 9,500 daily active users (April 2022)
- 1,300 monthly active users (2.5 years post-launch)
- Global player base across multiple continents

**Technical Achievements:**
- 42+ years of guaranteed unique puzzles
- 100% offline functionality
- Cross-platform PWA support
- Zero server costs (static hosting)

## Lessons Learned

### Mathematical Game Design
The permutation generation challenge taught me the importance of mathematical rigor in game design. Creating a system that guarantees uniqueness for decades required deep understanding of combinatorics and algorithm design.

### PWA Development
Building a fully offline-capable game showed the power of modern web technologies. Service workers, local storage, and PWA features can create experiences that rival native apps.

### Community Engagement
The game's success demonstrated how timing and community engagement can amplify a project's impact. Launching during the Wordle craze and starting a Discord server where players are encouraged to share their daily scores helped reach a massive audience.

## Future Possibilities

While Turdle continues to serve its daily players, the mathematical framework could be extended to include:
- Different animation themes
- Variable puzzle lengths & colors
- Leaderboards

The core innovation of mathematically generated unique puzzles has applications far beyond word games.
