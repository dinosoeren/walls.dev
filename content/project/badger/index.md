Nametags?? That's right. Badger is proprietary software in the form of a web app designed to secure brick and mortar businesses. It's fun and intuitive, and to be clear, it was NOT my idea. I worked on Badger as part of a team at [Foxfeather Software](http://www.foxfeathersoftware.com/); as the lead programmer, I created the user interface and the print server.

When a business uses Badger, volunteers, consultants, employees, or any guest in the building can sign in instantly upon arrival via their personal mobile device or the business' kiosk. Through the power of our secure print server, the guest can then pick up their printed nametag within seconds, featuring their name, role, date verified, and even a personalized avatar.

This is a simple but effective solution for businesses that wish to comply with the highest security standards. Administrators can access the backend of the web application and instantly see who signed in/out and when.

## Simple, Responsive

Designed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind for the best user experience. Layout is responsive for a seamless transition to tablets and phones.

## Secure

In addition to being attractive and clearly legible, our date-stamped badges are more secure than handwritten nametags and cannot be counterfeited.

## Convenient

Automatically registers visitors into a searchable database organized by date. This can be integrated with your own database to enforce unique sign-ins.

## Customizable

Isn't the UI nice? My brother Kirby designed it. We make a good team.
