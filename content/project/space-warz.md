A simple Java experiment, this is a 2D top-down space shooter videogame made for PC. Inspired by Space Invaders, it features waves of enemy ships on each level who shoot lasers at the player, mini-bosses on every 2nd level, shields, and many other basic features. Check out the code on Github.

This was actually my final project for my Computer Science I class, which I completed in a weekend. It's a little buggy, but it was ridiculously fun to make. If you want to try it out, feel free to download it below (requires Java to run).

- [Download `.jar`](../../bin/space-warz.jar) - All operating systems
- [Download `.exe`](../../bin/space-warz.exe) - Windows only
