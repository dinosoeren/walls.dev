I converted this website from standard HTML to WordPress at the client's request. It includes a modified WordPress theme, e-merchant capabilities including a shopping cart and checkout process, integration of an SSL certificate to legally allow handling of transaction info, a familiar WordPress-powered CMS, and more client-friendly features.
