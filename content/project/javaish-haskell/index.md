## My Last Stand (with a Functional Language)

It was April of my senior year of college. The finish line was in sight. Just one more final project stood between me and graduation. The course? Programming Languages. The challenge? Build a fully-functional interpreter for a subset of Javaâ€”lovingly nicknamed "Javaish"â€”using a language I had only just been introduced to: Haskell.

At Colorado College, we had the [Block Plan](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/basics/blockplan/), which meant this entire course, from researching a comprehensive history of programming languages, to learning Haskell's syntax and submitting the final project, was compressed into three and a half weeks. It was a crash course in imperative vs functional programming, compilers, and sleep deprivation. And honestly? I loved every minute of it.

## The most fun challenges

Building an interpreter from scratch felt like peering under the hood of programming itself. It's one thing to write code; it's another to write code that understands and runs *other* code.

### 1. From Text to Tree: Tokenizing and Parsing

The first step in any interpreter is to make sense of the source code, which is really just a long string of text. This process has two parts:

1. **Lexing/Tokenizing:** Chopping the string into meaningful chunks, or "tokens." For example, `class`, `{`, `myVar`, `123`.
2. **Parsing:** Arranging those tokens into a structured tree (an Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST) that represents the program's logic.

For this, I used the classic Haskell duo: **Alex** for lexing and **Happy** for parsing. They're the Haskell world's answer to the venerable `lex` and `yacc`.

The tokenizer definition in `javaish_tok.hs` maps raw strings to my custom `Token` types.

```haskell
-- From javaish_tok.hs
alex_action_1 =  addPosn TClass 
alex_action_2 =  addPosn TNew 
alex_action_3 =  addPosn TString 
-- ...and so on for every keyword and symbol...
alex_action_19 =  addPosnS( TIntLiteral . read )
alex_action_32 =  addPosnS( TIdent )
```

Once Alex gave me a stream of tokens, Happy's job was to assemble them into our AST, which I defined in `javaish_parse.hs`. The `ExpOnly` data type is a great example of how I represented different kinds of expressions.

```haskell
-- From javaish_parse.hs
data ExpOnly
    = ExpOp Exp Char Exp
    | ExpComOp Exp Char Exp
    | ExpArray Exp Exp
    | ExpFCall Exp Ident [ Exp ]
    | ExpInt Int
    | ExpNewInt Exp
    | ExpBool Bool
    | ExpIdent Ident
    | ExpNewIdent Ident
    | ExpThis
    | ExpNot Exp
    | ExpLength Exp
    | ExpError
    deriving (Show, Eq)
```

*It's just so clean! Using Haskell's algebraic data types to model the language's structure felt incredibly powerful.*

### 2. The Heart of the Interpreter: Making it Run

With a beautiful AST in hand, the real magic could begin: evaluation. The core of the interpreter is a set of recursive functions that walk the tree and "do" what the code says.

The state of our "Javaish" programâ€”variables, class definitions, objectsâ€”was managed in a few key data structures. The `Value` type shows how we could represent all the possible data types within our interpreted language.

```haskell
-- From interpreter.hs
data Value
  = VInt    Int
  | VFloat  Float
  | VString String
  | VObj    ObjInfo
  | VBool   Bool
  | VArray  Int [ Value ]
  deriving( Eq, Show )
```

The main workhorse was the `interp_stmt` function. It's essentially a giant `case` statement that uses pattern matching on the AST. This is where the elegance of Haskell really shines. You can see how cleanly it handles an `if/else` statement:

```haskell
-- From interpreter.hs
interp_stmt ( Stmt stmt p ) =
  case stmt of
    -- { <stmts> }
    SList stmts -> forM_ stmts interp_stmt

    -- if <test> then <thenStmt> else <elseStmt>
    SIfElse test thenStmt elseStmt -> do
        VBool testTrue <- interp_exp test
        if testTrue then
          interp_stmt thenStmt
        else
          interp_stmt elseStmt
    
    -- ... and cases for all other statement types
```

> ðŸ’¡ **The Impurity of State**
>
> Haskell is a "pure" functional language, but interpreters need to manage state (like changing the value of a variable). I had to venture into the "impure" world using `IORef`, which is basically a mutable reference. It was my first real brush with monads and managing side effects, and it definitely stretched my brain.

### 3. All Together Now: Running "Javaish" Code

After weeks of work, it was time for the moment of truth. Our professor provided a test file, `test.javaish`, that used classes, inheritance, and method calls to see if everything worked.

```java
// From test.javaish
class parent {
    int g;

    public int f1(int a) {
        { System.out.println( 2 ); }
        return a;
    }
}

class kiddo extends parent {

    public int f2(int b) {
        { System.out.println( 3 ); }
        return this.f1(b);
    }
}

class T01 {
    public static void main( String [] args )
    {
        System.out.println( (new kiddo()).f2(1) );
    }
}
```

This program creates a `kiddo` object, calls its `f2` method (which prints `3`), which in turn calls the `parent`'s `f1` method (which prints `2`), and finally prints the return value (`1`).

Seeing the correct output appear on my screen after piping this file into my compiled Haskell program was a satisfying moment.

## Final Thoughts

This project was more than just a final assignment; it was bringing concepts into practice I had learned in CP404 Theory of Computation. It forced me to grapple with complex ideas like parsing, evaluation, state management, and functional programming paradigms (although admittedly, monads are still pretty confusing!).

It taught me that the languages we use fundamentally shape how we think about problems. And sometimes, the best way to understand a language is to try and build one yourself.

## Source Code

The complete source code, including the tokenizer, parser, and interpreter, is available on GitHub. Feel free to browse, but please don't judge my 2017-era Haskell too harshly!
