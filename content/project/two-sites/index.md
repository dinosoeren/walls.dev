## An Early Career Lesson

This project involved creating two WordPress e-commerce sites for the same client: a doctor who ran both a chiropractic health center and a textbook publishing spinoff. As one of my first paid contract jobs, it provided a foundational learning experience in client relations and the business of software development.

The technical task was straightforward. I converted a basic HTML site for the health center into a dynamic WordPress site. For the publisher, I built a full e-commerce solution with a shopping cart, checkout process, and SSL integration. I was proud of the results and the value I delivered.

The most significant takeaway, however, came from the business side of the project. When it was time to settle the invoice, the client disputed the hours I had meticulously tracked, offering to pay less than half the agreed-upon amount.

As a young & upcoming web contractor, it was a challenging situation. I chose to accept the reduced payment to close the project, but I also learned the importance of clear communication and standing up for the value of my work. I respectfully declined future projects with the client, including a proposal to convert his textbooks to ePub format, making it clear that I would only continue our partnership if my work was valued at the agreed-upon rate.

## Reflections

Though the businesses have since closed and the sites are no longer live, the lessons I learned from this experience have been invaluable. It taught me how to advocate for myself, set professional boundaries, and approach contracts with a clearer understanding of the importance of mutual respect. These screenshots are a reminder of not just the work I did, but of the crucial business acumen I gained early in my career.
