Late one October night in 2018, I stepped onto the stage at the Fox Theater in Redwood City, California, as a soloist for [Alphabeat](https://www.techapella.org/alphabeat)—one of Google’s a cappella groups—at the annual Techapella concert. The house was packed with over 500 people, my largest musical audience ever. My heart was pounding, my hands were shaking, and I was about to sing lead on "*Bottom of the River*" by Delta Rae, arranged by our then musical director, Michael Patashnik.

## The Road to the Fox Theater

When I joined Alphabeat, I was just looking for a way to keep music in my life while working at Google. I ended up singing baritone with Alphabeat for two years, and this performance was my first time front and center. The nerves were real, but so was the thrill. As the lights came up and the first notes rang out, I let the adrenaline carry me. The energy from the crowd and my group was electric. By the end, I felt a rush of adrenaline and a craving for more.

## From Stage to Studio: My First Spotify Feature

That night was just the beginning. Later in 2018, Alphabeat recorded our Techapella setlist and released it as an album on Spotify—my first professional studio experience, and my first-ever feature as an artist on the platform. You can listen to our version of "*Bottom of the River*" [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/1cHVzM29SkVmIdqR1F3xem). I also sing baritone on several other tracks on the album.

Recording in the studio was a whole new challenge—learning to listen for every detail, to blend carefully, to bring the same energy as a live show but with the precision the studio demands. Hearing the final mix, knowing my voice was part of something bigger, was an incredible feeling. Shout out to our producer for making me sound even better!

## Lessons from the Spotlight

Stepping into the soloist role taught me more than just how to project my voice and blend with the group. It taught me to embrace discomfort, to trust my preparation, and to let go of perfection in favor of connection. Performing for 500+ people was nerve-racking, but it was also a rush I’ll never forget.

**Takeaway:** Sometimes the scariest opportunities are the ones that help you grow the most. Whether it’s pitching a startup, breaking something at work, or singing your heart out on stage, leaning into the nerves can lead to your proudest moments.
