The question I've been asked most since joining Stash a few months ago isn't about our tech, or our roadmap, or even gaming trends. It's usually, "So, do you have to have a 'stache (mustache) to work at Stash?" üòÇ (For the record, the answer is a resounding 'no,' though we do appreciate a good one!).

What truly hit me when I made the leap was the *actual* energy here ‚Äì a collective drive to genuinely empower game developers and redefine payments in the mobile gaming world. We've been heads-down building, innovating, and dreaming big about creating something truly game-changing. üöÄ

Fast forward to today, and that passion and hard work are getting some incredible recognition! I'm excited to share that **Stash has been nominated for 'Best Payment Provider' at the Mobile Game Awards 2025!** ü§© This isn't just a nomination; it's a huge shout-out to the entire team's dedication to making payments seamless, secure, and truly enabling for the industry.

If you're in the gaming industry and believe in the power of truly developer-first solutions, we'd be incredibly grateful for your vote. It takes just a moment and means the world to us! Let's help Stash bring this home. üôè

Cast your vote here **before July 31** (2 weeks remaining!): https://www.pocketgamer.biz/mga2025/vote/best-payment-service-provider/

And between us, it would mean a lot if you could let me know in the comments or in a DM that you voted! What do you think makes a payment provider truly 'best-in-class' for the gaming world? Is it a stylish 'stache, or something else? Let's chat!
