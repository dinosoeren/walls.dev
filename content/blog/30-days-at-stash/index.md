So, I've officially hit the 30-day mark at my new startup gig at [Stash](https://stash.gg), and it's been a whirlwind! Leaving the comfort of a big company (more on that in another post üòâ) has been eye-opening. Here are my 5 biggest takeaways:

1. **The Hybrid Hustle is Real (and Awesome):** I'm appreciating the flexibility of working from home to laser-focus, but I struck GOLD with an invite to a company off-site just before I joined to build relationships in-person. It's a privilege to have both.
2. **Ears > Elbows (at first):** My instinct is always to jump in and contribute, but I've learned that slowing down to really listen and understand the context is way more valuable in the long run. As my friend & mentor Omer Baror said in his recent post, delivering impact doesn't come from working more, but from figuring out how to work differently. I couldn't have delivered my first feature to customers without listening to find out which of my possible first tasks mattered most.
3. **Beating Burnout with Boundaries AND a Bold Mindset:** Startups are notorious for long hours, but I'm determined to avoid the burnout trap. My secret weapon? Actively seeking challenges that excite me. When you're driven by passion, those "long hours" feel different. And yes, setting boundaries is crucial! When doing so, the great Marshall Goldsmith taught me that "feed forward" is just as valuable, if not more valuable, than feedback.
4. **Growth Lives Outside Your Comfort Zone:** Let's be honest, I've felt pretty uncomfortable at times. But I'm choosing to see that as a sign I'm stretching and learning. Embrace the wobble!
5. **Breaking Things Isn't Failing ‚Äì It's Fortune in Disguise:** I definitely broke something already ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. My initial reaction was mortification, but then I realized it was a chance to showcase my problem-solving skills. Turns out, "oops" can be a superpower.
