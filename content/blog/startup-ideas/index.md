- Your idea may be genius, but it is (almost) certainly not unique. Someone else is thinking the same thing.
- To see how people react to first hearing the idea. (this of course requires crafting a great elevator pitch)
- Other people offer unique insights and perspectives that help you improve.
- Keeping secrets makes for enemies and lost opportunities.
- Being open and honest shows confidence, which is not only a good marketing strategy, but also makes for allies and partners you might not expect.
- When's the last time you heard of a successful startup consisting of exactly one person?
- Eventually you'll have to tell someone, or else who will buy it? Startups may appear to pop up out of nowhere into sudden popularity, but behind the scenes they've spent years coming up with marketing. There's no such thing as overnight success.
- Others' support can help motivate you to actually bring the idea to fruition.
- If someone does steal your idea, in the end, it's doesn't matter. Execution is what matters. Henry Ford, for example.
